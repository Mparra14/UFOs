# UFO CHALLENGE

Github webpage link: https://mparra14.github.io/UFOs/

## Overview:
In this project, we were tasked with creating a new website that would include data for UFO sightings. We were given data in Javascript array, which we had to iterate through using Javascript and  display this new website using HTML. In order to create a functinualized website that people would be able to navigate through, we had to create filters for each element that would be searched through. These elements included date, country, state and shape of the UFO. Creating these filters makes the website dynamic for user input.
