# UFO CHALLENGE

Github webpage link: https://mparra14.github.io/UFOs/

## Overview:
In this project, we were tasked with creating a new website that would include data for UFO sightings. We were given data in Javascript array, which we had to iterate through using Javascript and  display this new website using HTML. In order to create a functinualized website that people would be able to navigate through, we had to create filters for each element that would be searched through. These elements included date, country, state and shape of the UFO. Creating these filters makes the website dynamic for user input.

## Results:
When it comes to using the website itself, it's pretty simple. You can search by date, state, country or shape. When a user would like to search for a specific date for a UFO sighting, they can type the date such as "1/1/2010" on the search bar and they would be able to see the results on the table on the right of the page. You can see this process on the images below.

If the user would like to see the states that there have been UFO sightings, they can search for a state (but only using two letter state name) on the search bar. This will then pull all the sightings in that specific state. For example, the state of Arizona, you would type the two letter state identifier "ca" and the results would come up in the table on the right of the page.

If the user would like to search for a city, to refine their search they can also type the city name in the search bar to get their results on the table. For example, San Diego, you would type "san diego" and see the results for it. You can see this in the pictures below.

If the user would like to search for the shape of the UFO, they can type it on the search bar. This refines the search even further, to specify the exact date and place the UFO appeared. For example, a shape like a triangle, they would type a "triangle" and the results would show up on the table; this can be seen on the images below. Keep in mind that the shapes are very specific to the reportings so please check the data table to search correctly.
